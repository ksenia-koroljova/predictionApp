# Shiny Application for students early dropout prediction
Web application is built using R Shiny and implements dropout prediction models for first-year students.
Users of the application can make either a single prediction or a prediction from a loaded Excel file by selecting the appropriate prediction model. If required, the user can save the prediction results in a suitable format (either .csv, .xls or .pdf).

One of the pages displays descriptive statistics of the models using graphs. In addition, the visualization of the previously collected responses is presented, for which the results of the questionnaire, essay and interview of the first-year students for the years 2019-2021 were used.
